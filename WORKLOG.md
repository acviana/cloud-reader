Agent memory bank. Each increment is logged here with what was built, decisions
made, options discarded, and any dead ends. Read this before starting any new
work to avoid re-litigating settled decisions or repeating failed approaches.

## Increment 0 — Monorepo scaffold
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- Root `package.json` with pnpm workspace config and root-level scripts
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declaring `packages/*`
- Root `tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript settings (`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`)
- `.gitignore` covering `node_modules`, `.wrangler`, D1 local db files, build output
- `AGENTS.md` — full project context document
- `WORKLOG.md` — this file

### Decisions made
- **pnpm over npm:** Chosen for strict dependency isolation (prevents phantom deps
  between packages), faster installs, and consistency with the vega repo and the
  Kumo repo which both use pnpm.
- **Monorepo from the start:** Even though the CLI (phase 3) doesn't exist yet,
  the monorepo structure is established now so it doesn't require restructuring later.
  The `cli` package is not scaffolded yet — it will be added in phase 3.
- **TypeScript strict mode:** `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
  enabled from day one. These are harder to add later than to start with.

### Options considered and discarded
- **npm workspaces:** Rejected in favour of pnpm. npm's hoisting can cause phantom
  dependencies where a package accidentally imports something installed for a sibling
  package. pnpm's strict linking prevents this.
- **Single-package (no monorepo):** Rejected because the CLI tool (phase 3) needs
  to be a separate Node.js binary with its own `package.json` and build, and the
  frontend needs its own Vite build. A monorepo is the cleanest way to share types
  across all three without publishing to npm.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None at this stage.

## Increments 10–18 — Phase 2 Frontend
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `packages/app/` — full React SPA: Vite + Kumo + Tailwind v4 + `@phosphor-icons/react`
- `src/lib/api.ts` — typed fetch wrappers for all 6 REST endpoints, `ApiError` class
- `src/components/FeedSidebar.tsx` — Kumo `Sidebar` with feed list, unread badges, per-feed refresh, add feed button
- `src/components/AddFeedDialog.tsx` — Kumo `Dialog` + `Field` + `Input` for adding feeds
- `src/components/ArticleList.tsx` — article list with read/unread state, `Badge` for new articles
- `src/components/ArticleReader.tsx` — article detail pane, mark read/unread, open original link
- `src/App.tsx` — three-pane shell: sidebar + article list + reader, full state management
- `wrangler.jsonc` updated with `assets` binding pointing to `packages/app/dist/`
- `vite.config.ts` — `/api/*` proxied to wrangler dev server (port 8787)
- Production deployed to `https://cloud-reader.alexcostaviana.workers.dev`

### Decisions made
- **`Toasty` removed for now:** Kumo's `Toasty` component requires `children` and
  doesn't work as a standalone viewport. Deferred to phase 3 when proper toast
  notification wiring is needed.
- **CSS linting disabled in biome:** Tailwind v4's `@source` directive is not valid
  standard CSS and biome flags it as an error even with overrides. CSS is linted by
  Vite/Tailwind at build time instead.
- **Auto-mark-read on article open:** Selecting an article marks it as read
  automatically. Feels natural for an RSS reader.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- `Toasty.Provider` / `Toasty.Viewport` don't exist — `Toasty` is a flat component
  wrapping both.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` causes issues with Kumo's `render` prop pattern
  which spreads `className?: string` onto components expecting `className: string`.
  Fixed with `className={props.className ?? ""}`.
- `useCallback` dependency order matters — `handleAddFeed` originally referenced
  `handleRefreshFeed` before it was declared, and had an empty dep array. Biome's
  `useExhaustiveDependencies` rule caught this as a lint error during pre-commit.
  Fixed by reordering the callbacks.
- Biome v2 `@source` CSS parse error — fixed by disabling CSS linting globally in
  biome.json (`css.linter.enabled: false`).

## Increment 9 — D1 database setup
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `wrangler.jsonc` updated: `database_id` set to `996fad41-7d45-4254-8c22-aafd3950b673`,
  `migrations_dir` set to `drizzle`
- Migration `0000_silly_rumiko_fujikawa.sql` applied locally and remotely

### Decisions made
- **Kept binding name `DB`** (not `cloud_reader` as CF suggested) — `DB` is already
  used throughout all route handlers and is cleaner.
- **`migrations_dir: "drizzle"`** — wrangler defaults to `migrations/` but our
  Drizzle-generated files live in `drizzle/`. This must be set explicitly.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- First `db:migrate` failed because `migrations_dir` was not set in `wrangler.jsonc`.
  Wrangler looks for a `migrations/` folder by default and errors if it doesn't exist.

## Increment 7 — Articles API + tests
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `src/worker/routes/articles.ts` — Hono router: `GET /` with `?feed_id` and
  `?unread=true` query filters, `PATCH /:id` to mark read/unread
- `src/worker/articles.test.ts` — 9 tests: list all, filter by feed_id, filter
  by unread, combined filters, mark read, mark unread, 404 on unknown, 400 on
  missing field, 400 on invalid JSON

### Decisions made
- **`and(...conditions)` for dynamic filters:** Build condition array based on
  query params, spread into Drizzle's `and()`. Avoids nested if/else and works
  cleanly with zero, one, or two conditions.
- **`read` stored as integer, returned as integer:** The API returns `read: 0/1`
  directly from the DB. The frontend and CLI convert to boolean as needed. This
  keeps the DB representation transparent in the API response.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

---

## Increment 8 — Cron handler + tests
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `src/worker/cron.test.ts` — 3 tests: refreshes all feeds, tolerates one
  failure and continues, handles empty feed list

### Decisions made
- **`Promise.allSettled` in `runCron`:** Already in place from increment 6.
  Tests confirm that a 500 response from one feed URL does not prevent other
  feeds from being refreshed.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

## Increment 6 — Feeds API + Hono router
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `hono` added as a runtime dependency
- `src/worker/index.ts` — refactored to use `createApp(dbOverride?)` factory with
  Hono. DB injected via context variable middleware so routes are testable without
  a real D1 binding.
- `src/worker/routes/feeds.ts` — Hono router: `GET /`, `POST /`, `DELETE /:id`,
  `POST /:id/refresh`
- `src/worker/routes/articles.ts` — stub returning 501 (implemented in increment 7)
- `src/worker/cron.ts` — `runCron(db)` extracted from index
- `src/worker/feeds.test.ts` — 11 tests using `app.request()` with in-memory DB

### Decisions made
- **Hono over hand-rolled routing:** Switched at user request. Hono gives typed
  routing, `c.req.param()`, `c.json()`, middleware, and `app.request()` for testing
  — eliminates all the manual URL parsing and method switching.
- **`createApp(dbOverride?)` factory:** Allows tests to pass a `LibSQLDatabase`
  instance as the DB without needing a real D1 binding. The middleware injects it
  into Hono context so all routes use `c.get("db")` rather than calling
  `drizzle(c.env.DB)` directly — clean separation of construction from use.
- **`Variables` type on Hono app:** Typed context variables (`db: DrizzleD1Database`)
  give full type safety on `c.get("db")` throughout all route handlers.

### Options considered and discarded
- **Hand-rolled routing (original plan):** Rejected mid-increment at user request.
  The regex matching and manual method dispatch was already getting verbose.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

## Increment 5 — Refresh logic + tests
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `packages/worker/src/lib/refresh.ts` — `refreshFeed(feedId, db)`: loads feed from
  DB, fetches RSS URL, parses XML, updates feed metadata, upserts articles (check
  existence then insert or update), returns `{ added, updated }`.
- `packages/worker/src/lib/test-helpers.ts` — `createTestDb()`: creates an in-memory
  libsql database with the cloud-reader schema applied, used as a drop-in for D1 in tests.
- `packages/worker/src/lib/refresh.test.ts` — 9 tests: added count, article storage,
  feed metadata update, article fields, upsert on re-refresh, read flag preservation,
  feed-not-found error, HTTP failure error, unparseable XML error.
- `@libsql/client` added as devDependency for in-memory SQLite in tests.

### Decisions made
- **Check-then-insert upsert pattern:** D1's `onConflictDoUpdate` support in Drizzle
  requires careful handling with the `libsql` driver in tests. Using a
  select-then-insert-or-update pattern works identically across both D1 and libsql,
  keeping test behavior consistent with production.
- **`db as never` cast in tests:** The test DB is `LibSQLDatabase` but `refreshFeed`
  takes `DrizzleD1Database`. Both share compatible Drizzle query interfaces — casting
  avoids a complex generic type parameter on `refreshFeed` while keeping production
  types correct.
- **`vi.stubGlobal("fetch")` for network mocking:** No network calls in tests.
  `fetch` is stubbed globally per test via `beforeEach`/`afterEach`.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

## Increment 4 — RSS parsing + tests
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `packages/worker/src/lib/parse.ts` — `parseFeed(xml)` normalizes RSS 2.0 and Atom
  feeds into `ParsedFeed`. Handles: feed metadata (title, siteUrl, description, imageUrl),
  articles (url, title, summary, content, publishedAt), `content:encoded`, CDATA, Atom
  text constructs, Atom link rel filtering, fallback from `published` → `updated`.
- `packages/worker/src/lib/parse.test.ts` — 12 tests covering RSS 2.0, Atom, and edge
  cases (no image, no pubDate, invalid XML, unrecognized XML format).

### Decisions made
- **`fast-xml-parser` with `isArray` for `item`/`entry`:** Single-item feeds would
  otherwise return an object instead of an array. The `isArray` option forces consistent
  array output.
- **Filter articles with empty URL:** Articles with no resolvable URL are dropped
  rather than stored with an empty string, which would violate the `NOT NULL` constraint
  and cause upsert collisions.
- **`parseFeed` returns `null` on unrecognized format:** Caller decides how to handle
  (log and skip vs. error).

### Dead ends / gotchas
- `allowImportingTsExtensions: true` is required in `tsconfig.json` to import
  `./parse.ts` with the `.ts` extension in test files. Without it, tsc errors even
  though Vitest handles it fine at runtime.

## Increment 3 — DB schema + migration
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `packages/worker/src/db/schema.ts` — Drizzle schema for `feeds` and `articles` tables
  with all finalized columns, foreign key with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and three explicit
  indexes on `articles`: `idx_articles_feed_id`, `idx_articles_read`, `idx_articles_published_at`
- `packages/worker/drizzle/0000_silly_rumiko_fujikawa.sql` — generated migration
- `packages/worker/drizzle/meta/` — drizzle-kit journal and snapshot

### Decisions made
- **Explicit index definitions in schema:** Drizzle does not auto-generate query
  indexes — only unique indexes. The three query indexes (`feed_id`, `read`,
  `published_at`) were added using `index()` in the third argument of `sqliteTable`.
- **`published_at` index is not DESC:** Drizzle's SQLite `index()` helper does not
  support descending index direction. A plain ascending index on `published_at` still
  helps the query planner for `ORDER BY published_at DESC` on small-to-medium datasets.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- Generated migration twice. First run lacked indexes (Drizzle only auto-generates
  unique indexes, not query indexes). Had to add `index()` calls to the schema and
  regenerate. The `drizzle/` folder was wiped and regenerated from scratch to get a
  clean `0000_` migration rather than `0001_`.

## Pre-commit hook — Biome + Husky
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `biome.json` — root biome v2 config: linter (recommended rules + `noUnusedImports: error`),
  formatter (2-space, 100 col, double quotes, trailing commas), file includes/excludes
- `.husky/pre-commit` — runs `pnpm lint-staged` then `pnpm type-check`
- `lint-staged` config in root `package.json` — biome lint + format on staged `*.ts/tsx/js/jsx`
- Root scripts: `lint`, `format`
- `husky` + `lint-staged` + `@biomejs/biome` installed as root devDependencies
- `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` already present — no changes needed

### Decisions made
- **Biome over ESLint:** Same tool as vega repo. Single binary, no plugin ecosystem to
  manage, lint + format in one pass.
- **Tests run in pre-commit:** Originally type-check only, but changed to also run
  `pnpm test:run` as an agent guardrail — prevents agents from committing broken code
  without noticing. `--passWithNoTests` prevents failure before test files exist.
- **lint-staged for biome:** Only lints files staged for the current commit — avoids
  re-linting the entire repo on every commit.

### Options considered and discarded
- **lefthook:** Used by Kumo repo. Rejected because husky is simpler, already used
  by vega, and works well with pnpm workspaces.
- **Running tests in pre-commit:** Rejected — test suite will grow and a slow hook
  gets bypassed with `--no-verify`. Type-check catches the most common class of errors.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- Biome v2 changed the config schema from v1. `organizeImports` is now under
  `assist.actions.source`, and `files.ignore` is now `files.includes` with `!` prefixes.
  Running `biome migrate --write` fixed this automatically.
- `biome lint --write` does not apply "unsafe" fixes — the `process.env["KEY"]` →
  `process.env.KEY` suggestion required manual edits despite being trivially safe.

## Increment 2 — Worker package scaffold
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `packages/worker/package.json` — `@cloud-reader/worker`, deps: `drizzle-orm`, `fast-xml-parser`, `@cloud-reader/types`; devDeps: `wrangler`, `drizzle-kit`, `vitest`, `@cloudflare/workers-types`
- `packages/worker/tsconfig.json` — extends root, adds `@cloudflare/workers-types`
- `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc` — D1 binding (placeholder `database_id` until increment 9), hourly cron trigger
- `packages/worker/drizzle.config.ts` — `d1-http` driver, credentials from env vars
- `packages/worker/vitest.config.ts` — Node environment, `src/**/*.test.ts`
- `packages/worker/src/worker/index.ts` — minimal stub with correct `Env` interface and placeholder handlers
- Root `package.json` updated with `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` to approve native build scripts for `esbuild`, `sharp`, `workerd`

### Decisions made
- **`database_id: "placeholder"`** in `wrangler.jsonc` — actual ID requires running
  `wrangler d1 create` which needs CF credentials. Deferred to increment 9.
- **`drizzle.config.ts` uses env vars for credentials** — `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`,
  `CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN`. These are only needed for
  `drizzle-kit studio` / remote operations, not for local dev or tests.
- **`pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`** in root `package.json` — pnpm v9+ requires
  explicit approval for packages that run install scripts. Added `esbuild`, `sharp`,
  `workerd` (wrangler's runtime binary).

### Dead ends / gotchas
- `ScheduledEvent` is the wrong type for the `scheduled()` handler — the correct
  type is `ScheduledController`. `ScheduledEvent` is the DOM event interface.
  Fixed before committing.

## Increment 1 — Shared types package
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `packages/types/package.json` — `@cloud-reader/types` workspace package
- `packages/types/tsconfig.json` — extends root tsconfig
- `packages/types/src/index.ts` — canonical types:
  - `Feed`, `NewFeed`
  - `Article`, `UpdateArticle`
  - `RefreshResult`, `ApiError`
  - `ParsedFeed`, `ParsedFeedMeta`, `ParsedArticle` — internal shape from parser

### Decisions made
- **No runtime code:** Package is types-only. The `exports` field points directly
  to `src/index.ts` — no build step needed for a types-only package.
- **`ParsedFeed` types included here:** Even though `parse.ts` lives in the worker,
  the parsed feed shape is defined in types so the CLI could eventually use it too
  if it ever parses feeds locally.
- **`read` stays as `number` (not `boolean`):** SQLite stores booleans as integers.
  The `Article` interface reflects the DB representation (`0` / `1`) to avoid
  silent coercion bugs. The API layer converts to boolean when needed.

### Options considered and discarded
- **Separate `ParsedFeed` types in worker:** Rejected — if the CLI ever parses feeds
  locally, it would need to duplicate these types. Defining them in `@cloud-reader/types`
  is free and keeps the canonical source clear.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

## Post-phase-2 fixes and features
**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Complete

### What was built

**Content rendering**
- Added `marked` for markdown → HTML conversion in `ArticleReader`
- Heuristic: content with HTML tags treated as raw HTML, otherwise parsed as Markdown
- Applied same renderer to `summary` fallback path
- Added `@tailwindcss/typography` so `prose` classes apply typographic styles

**Article sort order**
- Toggle button in `ArticleList` header — newest/oldest first (default: newest)
- Local state in `ArticleList`, resets on feed change
- Falls back to `createdAt` for articles with no `publishedAt`

**Article title as link**
- `ArticleReader` title is an `<a>` opening the original URL in a new tab
- Conditionally rendered — plain `<span>` if no URL

**Site name in article reader**
- `ArticleReader` receives `feed` prop, passed from `App` via `selectedArticleFeed`
- Displays `feed.title · date` below title, separator only shown when both present

**Site name on article cards**
- `ArticleList` receives `feedsById: Record<string, Feed>` from `App`
- Feed title shown on each card in "All articles" view only

**HTML entity decoding**
- Replaced manual regex entity list with `DOMParser`
- Handles all named and numeric entities (`&#8217;`, `&mdash;`, etc.) in one pass

**Dark mode toggle**
- Moon/sun icon in sidebar footer, state in `App.tsx`
- Initialises from `window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")`
- Sets `document.documentElement.style.colorScheme` — Kumo's `light-dark()` tokens respond automatically

**GitHub source link**
- `GithubLogoIcon` + "Source code" in sidebar footer, opens repo in new tab

### Decisions made
- **`DOMParser` over regex:** Browser's own HTML parser handles every entity correctly. Previous regex only covered a handful of named entities.
- **`marked` over custom renderer:** Small, fast, zero deps, synchronous mode works in React render.
- **Dark mode via `colorScheme` not `.dark` class:** Kumo explicitly uses CSS `light-dark()` which responds to the `color-scheme` property, not a class toggle.
- **Sort is client-side only:** API returns all articles already; a `?sort=` param adds API complexity for no real benefit at current scale.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- `Toasty.Provider` / `Toasty.Viewport` don't exist — `Toasty` is a flat component. Removed; toast notifications deferred to phase 3.
- Biome CSS linter flags Tailwind v4's `@source` directive as invalid. Fixed by setting `css.linter.enabled: false` in `biome.json`.
- `useCallback` dependency order: `handleAddFeed` referenced `handleRefreshFeed` before declaration with an empty dep array. Biome's `useExhaustiveDependencies` caught this at pre-commit. Fixed by reordering.

---

## UI polish
**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Complete

### What was built

**Article reader layout**
- Toolbar moved to a slim top bar (mark read + open external); header moved into the
  scrollable content area so it scrolls with the article
- Content constrained to `max-w-2xl` centred column for comfortable line length
- Title bumped to `text-3xl font-bold` with tight tracking
- `prose` / `prose-sm` classes dropped — replaced with a hand-rolled `.article-body`
  class in `app.css` that uses Kumo CSS variables (`var(--color-kumo-*)`) directly,
  giving correct dark mode behaviour for headings, links, code, blockquotes, lists, images

**Article list cards**
- `bg-kumo-base` added to both the populated and empty-state variants so all three
  panes share the same background colour
- "New" `Badge` replaced with a small `h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-kumo-brand` dot —
  less visually noisy
- Spacing tightened: `mt-1.5` on summary, `mt-2` on metadata row, `gap-1.5` between metadata items
- Separator dot between site name and date in the metadata row

### Decisions made
- **Hand-rolled `.article-body` CSS over `prose`:** Tailwind Typography's `prose`
  classes don't use Kumo's CSS variables, so colors break in dark mode. The custom
  class is ~80 lines and covers all the cases we need.
- **`bg-kumo-base` on all panes:** Kumo's sidebar already has its own background.
  Explicitly setting `bg-kumo-base` on the article list and reader ensures they
  switch correctly with the dark mode toggle instead of defaulting to the browser's
  background color.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- Missing `bg-kumo-base` on `ArticleList` caused the cards to appear a different
  shade from the sidebar and reader panes. Both the populated and empty-state
  branches of the component needed the class added.

---

## Sidebar polish + refresh button reorganisation
**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Complete

### What was built

**Sidebar width and resizability**
- `Sidebar.Provider` now has `defaultWidth={280}` (up from Kumo's ~240px default),
  `minWidth={220}`, and `resizable` — drag the edge to any width

**Sidebar layout cleanup**
- "All articles" moved into its own `Sidebar.Group` above a `Sidebar.Separator`,
  so it's visually distinct from the per-feed list
- "Feeds" group label moved to the feed list group where it's contextually correct
- Footer dark-mode toggle and GitHub link converted to proper `Sidebar.MenuButton`
  items (with icons), replacing the custom `<div>` + `<Button>` combo
- `PlusIcon` added to "Add feed" for consistent icon treatment across footer items

**Refresh button reorganisation**
- Removed per-feed `Sidebar.MenuAction` refresh icons from every feed row — too cluttered
- Added a single refresh-all `Sidebar.MenuAction` next to "All articles" — spins while
  running, uses `Promise.allSettled` so one failing feed doesn't block others
- Added per-feed refresh button in the `ArticleList` header — only shown when a single
  feed is selected, hidden on "All articles" view

### Decisions made
- **Refresh-all on sidebar, per-feed refresh in article list header:** Matches the
  mental model — the sidebar is navigation, the article list header is context for
  the current view. Refresh belongs in the context, not the nav.
- **`Promise.allSettled` for refresh-all:** Consistent with the cron handler. One
  bad feed URL shouldn't block all others from refreshing.

### Options considered and discarded
- **Per-app colour theming (Solarized, Tokyo Night, Dracula, Nord etc.):** Explored
  but rejected. Kumo owns its component colours via CSS `light-dark()` and `--color-kumo-*`
  variables. Theming only the parts we own (article body, cards) while Kumo's chrome
  stays neutral would look fragmented. Deferred indefinitely.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

---

## Delete feed button
**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `TrashIcon` button in `ArticleList` header — only shown when a single feed is selected
- Two-step inline confirmation: click trash → "Confirm" / "Cancel" appear in the header
- `handleDeleteFeed` in `App.tsx`: calls `feedsApi.delete(id)`, clears `selectedFeedId`,
  `articles`, and `selectedArticleId` — returns UI to global "All articles" view
- `onDeleteFeed` prop on `ArticleList` (`(() => void) | null`)

### Decisions made
- **Inline confirm/cancel over a dialog:** A modal for a single destructive action is
  heavy. Inline confirm keeps the interaction in-place and dismisses cleanly with Cancel.
- **Delete returns to "All articles":** Avoids a broken empty pane for the deleted feed.
- **Header location over sidebar:** Delete is contextual to the current feed view — the
  article list header is the right place. Keeps the sidebar clean.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

---

## Aesthetic improvements
**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- **`app.css`** — `font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif` on `.article-body`
- **`ArticleList`** — article count inline with title (`All articles · 42`), removed separate count line
- **`ArticleList`** — left border accent on unread cards (`border-l-2 border-kumo-brand`), transparent border on read cards to preserve layout stability
- **`ArticleList`** — read cards `opacity-60` for clearer visual hierarchy
- **`ArticleList`** — article list pane widened from `w-80` (320px) to `w-96` (384px)
- **`ArticleReader`** — toolbar: `bg-kumo-surface` background, `py-3` padding
- **`ArticleReader`** — mark-read button fixed `w-32` to prevent layout shift on label change
- **`ArticleReader`** — `<hr>` separator between article header and body

### Decisions made
- **Both border and tint on selected+unread:** The blue left border is a read/unread indicator; the tint is a selection indicator. They're orthogonal so both show simultaneously.
- **Transparent border on read cards:** Using `border-transparent` rather than no border keeps all cards the same total width — prevents layout shift when items transition read↔unread.
- **`opacity-60` on read cards:** More visually effective than just dimming the title text alone, which was easy to miss.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- None.

## Fix: fast-xml-parser entity expansion limit
**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** Complete

### What was built
- `processEntities: { maxTotalExpansions: 100000 }` in `XMLParser` config in `src/lib/parse.ts`
- Regression test added: feeds with >1000 HTML entities in `content:encoded` now parse correctly

### Root cause
`fast-xml-parser` defaults to `processEntities: true` (boolean), which sets `maxTotalExpansions: 1000`.
Feeds with full article content in `content:encoded` encode all HTML as XML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`,
`&amp;`, etc.). A feed with 82 articles easily exceeds 10,000 entity expansions. Parser threw
`Entity expansion limit exceeded`, `parseFeed()` returned `null`, Worker returned 502.

### Dead ends / gotchas
- `entityExpansionLimit` is not a valid XMLParser option.
- `htmlEntities: { maxTotalExpansions: ... }` does not control this path — it's a separate option.
- 10,000 was not enough either — the feed has >10,000 entity expansions across 82 articles. Set to 100,000.
